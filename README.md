CPSC 340 take home final group portion.

Currently it classifies the external dataset with 95+% accuracy with 5 or more epochs, but there is an issue with classifying the 340 dataset. 
The images should be in folders as such:
\dataset
    \train
        \covid
        \normal
    \valid
        \covid
        \normal
